        <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
          <p>
            According to Ethiopian legend, coffee was discovered in the 9th century by a young goat herder from the Kaffa region named Kaldi. He noticed his goats dancing and acting silly after eating the red berries of an unknown shrub. So, Kaldi decided to try the strange fruit himself, and he soon realized that it gave him an energy boost like nothing else.<br><br>Kaldi excitedly shared his discovery with the local monks, who, despite initial skepticism, eventually soaked the red berries in hot water. They found that the resulting beverage not only tasted delicious but also kept them awake during long nights of prayer.<br><br>And so the earliest form of coffee was born.

          <p>
            It wasn't until the 1500s that coffee began to be cultivated in Ethiopia. Before, coffee beans were just harvested from coffee plants growing naturally in the wild. But by the 16th century, cultivation techniques had been established, and coffee was being grown as a commercial crop.<br><br>At the same time, trade with neighboring countries, particularly Yemen, enabled Ethiopia to share its coffee with the rest of the world. As its popularity spread, so too did its reputation as a superior beverage unlike any other.<br><br>By the 1800s, the cultivation of coffee had become a major industry in Ethiopia. The country was producing some of the finest beans in the world and exporting them to other countries for consumption. As coffee production spread, so did Ethiopian coffee culture. Cafes began to spring up in the major cities, offering a place for people to come together and enjoy a hot cup of coffee.<br><br>In addition, Ethiopian coffee ceremonies—elaborate rituals involving the preparation and serving of coffee—became a regular part of daily life. These ceremonies (which still take place today) involve the roasting over a fire, followed by the grading and brewing of the beverage in ornately decorated jebena pots. It's a time to connect with friends, family, and community members over a shared cup of coffee.

          <p>
            Today, Ethiopia grows more than a thousand varieties of coffee beans, each with its own distinct flavor. But it's the indigenous arabica coffee variety that reigns supreme and remains one of the Ethiopia's most popular and highly sought-after varieties.<br><br>Like with most other plants, coffee beans grow in the shade, without the use of agricultural chemicals, for a dense and intense flavor that is instantly recognizable.

            <h4>Sidamo</h4>
            <p>
                When it comes to Ethiopian coffee history, the Sidamo region is believed to be where it all originated from. These beans are strictly grown thousands of feet above sea level which results in a distinct flavor profile that includes blueberry mixed with citrus and a mild nuttiness.

                This Ethiopian coffee type is best enjoyed with a morning pastry that complements these flavors and adds sweetness since this coffee is more acidic.

            <h4>Yirgacheffe</h4>
            <p>
                While similar to Sidamo coffee, Yirgacheffe is widely considered to be one of the best beans in the world due to its clean, balanced, and mild flavor profile that has notes of berries, nuts, chocolate, lemon, and wine.

                This clean Ethiopian coffee taste is achieved by growing the berries at roughly 2,000 meters above sea level and wet-processing them, also known as washed processed.

            <h4>Guji</h4>
            <p>
                Guji coffee is also made using the wet process that brings out fruity, floral, and all-around darker notes. It’s known for being a strong coffee that is great for giving you the caffeine boost you might need in the morning. Its strong acidity means it also pairs well with baked goods for added sweetness.

            <h4>Genica</h4>
            <p>
                This Ethiopian coffee type is exclusively grown in the Bench Maji Zone. These beans are unique since they are small and are a greyish color. When brewed, you’re left with a cup of coffee that has an appealing aroma and hints of chocolate, spice, and wine that make it a great accompaniment to dessert.

            <h4>Harar</h4>
            <p>
                Hailing from Ethiopia’s Eastern highlands, Harar coffee is still sorted and naturally processed by hand. Its flavor profile includes hints of fruit and mocha but also has strong wine-like characteristics that make for a savory one-of-a-kind cup that can be enjoyed any time of day.

            <h4>Limu</h4>
            <p>
                While certainly not the last Ethiopian coffee type to exist, we’re ending our list with Limu coffee. This coffee comes from the Limmu Sakka district and is wet-processed. It’s known for being low in acidity so it might be the best beverage to start your day with if you prefer less acidic drinks.
